            Hi, my name is <b>Ignacio Gandolfo</b> and I am from Buenos Aires,
            Argentina.
            <br />
            <br /> I'm a FrontEnd Developer with experience in JavaScript,
            TypeScript, React.js, Vue.js While i specialize in FrontEnd
            development, I also have experience in backend development through
            creating APIs. This has helped me significantly in communicating
            with backend developers to seek and offer solutions.
            <br />
            <br />I am <b>open</b> to new collaborations or work where I can
            contribute and grow. Feel free to connect with me, links are in the
            footer.
            <br />
            Apart from coding I love to make discord servers,designs and do
            photography in my spare time.
